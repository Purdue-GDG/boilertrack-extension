//A service worker script is esentially a "background" script.
//once the exension is installed, this will always be "dormant" in the computer
//a service worker script is event driven, so we could use this script for something like
//"when the user openes brightspace, scan" or something, so that the system is always scanning in the background


//when the chrome extension is clicked:
//chrome.action.onClicked.addListener();
